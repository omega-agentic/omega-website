# OmegaCode Copy Guide

## The one rule
Every sentence must answer: "What does the customer GET?"
If it doesn't, delete it.

## Voice
- Confident, not arrogant
- Specific, not superlative  
- Developer-to-developer, not marketing-to-developer
- Short sentences. Short paragraphs. Lots of whitespace.

## Brand
- Product name: "OmegaCode" (one word, capital C)
- Domain: omegacode.ai
- Install command: `bun run omega`
- One unified product — no separate "Boost", "Code", "Chat" products
- GitHub: github.com/omegacode-ai

## Homepage flow
1. Hook: what you get (5 seconds)
2. Proof: metrics showing the improvement
3. Evidence: before/after with real code
4. Ease: 3 steps to install
5. Depth: technical foundations (for curious developers)
6. Features: unified feature grid (wire compression, typed framing, memory, verification)
7. Close: CTA

## Never explain OmegaCode's architecture on the homepage.
The homepage sells benefits. /technology explains the architecture.
